The berth plan indicates an ETB at TU13, but TOS shows a discrepancy of over 90 minutes due to tidal constraints. Additionally, the partner portal still reflects the outdated ETA, and the yard resource plan at PSA Keppel is displaying older figures.\nFurthermore, the pilotage request is pending, and the quay Q4 crane allocation is misaligned.\nPlease review the situation and provide a resolution as soon as possible. If escalation is necessary, kindly proceed accordingly.\nBest Regards,",
